If all is well, you should not have to rebuild this GRUB.
It has been compiled already for i386 architecture,
and you should be able to use it with Qemu.

Get the sources for the GRUB loader from GNU.
Download Grub loader, version 0.97, 
from ftp://alpha.gnu.org/gnu/grub/.
Do not download the binaries that are not complete,
missing the eltorito stage.

I downloaded the GRUB loader and extracted the sources
under ~/M2M/grub/grub-0.97. I will configure it to generate the
binaries under ~/M2M/grub/grub, using the following commands 
By default, it installs on /boot/grub
and this is not a good idea.

    $ cd ~/M2M/grub/grub-0.97
    $ ./configure â€“prefix=~/M2M/grub/grub
    $ make 
    $ make install

For more information about how to build the GRUB loader, 
please read the README file. 

WARNING: Last time I tried compiling it on Ubuntu,
         I needed gcc 3.4 to make it work, otherwise
         the objdump tool from binutils didn't strip
	 the stage1 appropriately and it was bigger than 512 bytes.
